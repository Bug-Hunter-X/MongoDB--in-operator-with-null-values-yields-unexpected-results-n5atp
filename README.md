# MongoDB $in operator and Null Values

This example demonstrates an uncommon issue with MongoDB's `$in` operator when used with arrays containing `null` values.  The `$in` operator, designed to check for the presence of a value within an array, does not always produce the intended outcome when `null` is present. This can lead to unexpected query results or even errors.  The solution explores strategies to handle `null` values to accurately filter documents.

## Bug Report
The original query incorrectly handles the case where a field might have a null value. The expected behavior is to find documents where the field equals 1 or 2 or is null; the observed behavior excludes documents where the field is null. 

## Solution
The solution employs the `$or` operator to check for the existence of any value within the array of 1, 2, or null.
